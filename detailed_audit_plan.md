# The Great Godot Code Adventure! A Super-Duper Detailed Plan!

Hello, brave coder! Welcome to a grand adventure where we'll make the code for our game, "Project Antares," super neat and tidy. Think of it like cleaning up a messy toy room. When all the toys are in the right boxes, it's much easier to play!

Our game's code is like a big box of LEGOs. All the pieces are there, but some are jumbled up. We're going to organize them so our game runs better and is easier to build new, fun things with!

## Part 1: Getting Our Tools Ready!

For this adventure, we don't need any new tools. We just need our sharp eyes, our thinking caps, and the magic tools Cline (that's me!) already has. We're all set to go!

---

## Part 2: The Big File Name Cleanup!

Every code file is like a toy. If we give our toys good, clear names, we can find them easily! Right now, some of our file names are written like `MyToy.gd` and others are written like `my_toy.gd`. The Godot rulebook says they should all be like `my_toy.gd`. So, let's fix them!

### Action Item 1: Rename `AIManager.gd`

1.  **The Renaming Spell!**
    *   We need to tell the computer to rename the file. We'll use this magic spell:
    ```
    git mv scripts/managers/AIManager.gd scripts/managers/ai_manager.gd
    ```
    *   **What this does:** It changes the file's name and tells our magic "git" book to remember this change.

2.  **The Treasure Hunt!**
    *   Now, we need to find all the places in our code that still use the old name. Let's go on a treasure hunt!
    *   I will look for any file that mentions `AIManager.gd`.

3.  **The Magic Word Swap!**
    *   If we find any files that use the old name, we'll use a magic word swap to replace it with the new name, `ai_manager.gd`.

4.  **Check Your Work!**
    *   After we're done, look in the `scripts/managers/` folder. Do you see a file named `ai_manager.gd`? Hooray!

### Action Item 2: Rename `AudioManager.gd`

1.  **The Renaming Spell!**
    ```
    git mv scripts/managers/AudioManager.gd scripts/managers/audio_manager.gd
    ```
2.  **The Treasure Hunt!**
    *   I will look for any file that mentions `AudioManager.gd`.
3.  **The Magic Word Swap!**
    *   If we find any, we'll swap the old name for `audio_manager.gd`.
4.  **Check Your Work!**
    *   Look in the `scripts/managers/` folder. Is `audio_manager.gd` there? Awesome!

... and so on for all the files that need renaming. I will go through each one, step-by-step, just like this. The other files are:
*   `ColonyManager.gd` -> `colony_manager.gd`
*   `CouncilManager.gd` -> `council_manager.gd`
*   `DataManager.gd` -> `data_manager.gd`
*   `DebugManager.gd` -> `debug_manager.gd`
*   `DemoManager.gd` -> `demo_manager.gd`
*   `EmpireManager.gd` -> `empire_manager.gd`
*   `GameManager.gd` -> `game_manager.gd`
*   `SaveLoadManager.gd` -> `save_load_manager.gd`
*   `SceneManager.gd` -> `scene_manager.gd`
*   `TechnologyEffectManager.gd` -> `technology_effect_manager.gd`

## Part 3: Making Our Code Talk the Same Language!

Our code needs to follow the same rules, just like we follow rules in a game. This makes it easy for everyone to understand.

### Action Item: Check Class Names

The name inside the file, called a `class_name`, should look like a proper name, like `MySuperRobot`. It should not look like `my_super_robot`.

1.  **The Inspector Gadget!**
    *   I will use my inspector gadget to look inside all the files and find the `class_name`.
2.  **The Fix-it List!**
    *   I will make a list of any `class_name` that isn't written in `PascalCase`.
3.  **The Correction Time!**
    *   For each one on our list, we'll go into the file and fix it! For example, if we find `class_name my_class`, we'll change it to `class_name MyClass`.

### Action Item: Check Function and Variable Names

Functions are things the code can *do*, and variables are things the code can *remember*. Their names should be in `snake_case`, like `jump_high` or `player_score`.

1.  **Spot the Difference!**
    *   I will look at a few files, like `ai_manager.gd`, and look for any function or variable names that look like `JumpHigh` or `PlayerScore`.
2.  **The Renaming Game!**
    *   If we find any, we'll change them. For example, `func JumpHigh():` will become `func jump_high():`.
    *   This is a big job, so we'll do it carefully, one file at a time.

## Part 4: Checking Our Signal Towers!

Signals are like secret messages our code sends to other parts of the code. For example, when the player finds a treasure, a signal can tell the score to go up!

### Action Item: Make Signals Clear

1.  **Reading the Messages!**
    *   I will look at all the signals in our game.
2.  **Adding Explanations!**
    *   If a signal is like a secret code with no explanation, it's hard to understand. We'll add a little note (a comment) above it to explain what it does.
    *   For example, if we see `signal treasure_found`, we'll add a note like:
        ```gdscript
        # Emitted when the player finds a treasure. Sends the treasure's value.
        signal treasure_found(value: int)
        ```
    *   This makes it super clear for anyone who reads our code!

---

## Part 5: The Final Check-up!

Once we've done all these things, our code will be so clean and organized! It will be easier to read, easier to fix, and easier to add new fun things to our game.

We'll have:
*   File names that are easy to read.
*   Code that follows all the right rules.
*   Signals that are clear and easy to understand.

You'll be a code-cleaning superhero! Let's get started on our adventure!
