Project Antares: Asset Production To-Do List

1. UI Graphics & Icons

General UI Sounds

These are the core sound effects needed for UI interaction, to be placed in assets/audio/sfx/ui/. They should be in .wav format.

    [ ] ui_hover.wav: A subtle sound for when the mouse hovers over a button or interactive element.

    [ ] ui_confirm.wav: A positive, affirmative sound for clicking buttons that proceed.

    [ ] ui_back.wav: A sound for closing windows or going back in a menu.

    [ ] ui_error.wav: A soft negative sound for when an action cannot be performed.

HUD & Colony Screen Icons

These icons are needed for the right-hand sidebar on the starmap and for the colony screen UI. They should be clear and readable at a small size (e.g., 32x32 pixels).

    [ ] resource_credits.png: Icon representing currency/credits.

    [ ] resource_food.png: Icon representing food production.

    [ ] resource_production.png: Icon representing industrial production (like a hammer or cog).

    [ ] resource_research.png: Icon representing research points (like a beaker or atom).

    [ ] population.png: A generic icon representing one unit of population.

    [ ] job_farmer.png: An icon for the farmer/cultivator job.

    [ ] job_worker.png: An icon for the worker/contributor job.

    [ ] job_scientist.png: An icon for the scientist/researcher job.

Technology Icons

A unique icon is needed for every technology in the game to populate the research screen.

    [ ] A unique icon for each of the ~50 technologies defined in gamedata/technologies/tech_tree.json.

        Examples: An icon for "Logic Systems", "Nanoforges", "Deflection Grids", etc.

Race Portraits

High-quality portraits are needed for diplomacy, the research screen, and leader popups.

    [ ] A portrait for each of the main playable races (e.g., Human, Silicoid, Psilon, etc.).

    [ ] A portrait for the scientist representative of each race.

UI Theme & Frames

To match the look of the reference images, we need textures for the UI panels and windows.

    [ ] A 9-Patch style border texture for UI panels, which allows the panel to be resized without stretching or distorting the corners.

    [ ] Custom textures for UI elements like buttons, sliders, and progress bars to match the game's sci-fi aesthetic.

2. In-Game Sprites & Textures

Celestial Bodies

These are the core visual assets for the galaxy map and the system view.

    [ ] star_base.png: The neutral, uncolored star image (already generated, but can be refined).

    [ ] barren.png: Sprite for Barren planets.

    [ ] gas_giant.png: Sprite for Gas Giant planets.

    [ ] asteroid_belt.png: Sprite for Asteroid Belt fields.

3. Audio Assets

Background Music

    [ ] Convert existing MP3 music tracks to .ogg format for better performance and smaller file size.

    [ ] (Optional) Compose or acquire additional tracks for different game states (e.g., main menu, starmap, combat, diplomacy).

Gameplay Sound Effects

Sounds for in-game events, to be placed in assets/audio/sfx/gameplay/.

    [ ] Ship movement confirmation sound.

    [ ] Colonization success sound.

    [ ] Building completion sound.

    [ ] Research breakthrough sound.

    [ ] Weapon firing sounds (lasers, missiles, etc.).

    [ ] Ship explosion sounds.
