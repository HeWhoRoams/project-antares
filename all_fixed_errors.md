# All Fixed Errors Report - Project Antares CI/CD Pipeline

## Summary
The CI/CD pipeline now runs successfully with "All tests passed". All critical syntax errors that were preventing script compilation have been resolved.

## Errors Fixed - Phase 1 (Initial Syntax Fixes)

### 1. galaxymanager.gd Indentation Error
- **Issue**: Line 74 had incorrect indentation causing "Expected statement, found 'Indent' instead"
- **Fix**: Corrected the indentation of `var procedural_systems = _galaxy_builder.build_galaxy(number_of_systems - 2)` to align properly with the surrounding code
- **File**: `res://scripts/managers/galaxymanager.gd`

### 2. AIManager.gd Return Value Issue  
- **Issue**: Function `_get_race_for_personality` had improper indentation of the default match case (`_:`) causing "Not all code paths return a value"
- **Fix**: Corrected the indentation of the default match case to properly align with the match statement
- **File**: `res://scripts/managers/AIManager.gd`

### 3. building_data.gd Parent Init Call
- **Issue**: Called `super._init()` in `_init()` function when parent class `BuildableItem` doesn't have an `_init()` method
- **Fix**: Removed the `super._init()` call since the parent class doesn't require initialization
- **File**: `res://gamedata/buildings/building_data.gd`

## Errors Fixed - Phase 2 (Missing Class Definitions)

### 4. RacePreset Class Issues
- **Issue**: RacePreset.gd had undefined functions being called and missing enum values
- **Fix**: Added missing enum values (HUMAN, SILICOID, MANTIS, KLACKON) and created missing `_setup_` methods for all race types
- **File**: `res://gamedata/races/race_preset.gd`

### 5. AIDecisionWeights Class
- **Issue**: AIDecisionWeights was defined as an inner class in AIManager.gd, making it inaccessible to other files
- **Fix**: Created separate `AIDecisionWeights.gd` file as a standalone class and removed the inner class from AIManager.gd
- **Files**: `res://gamedata/AIDecisionWeights.gd`, `res://scripts/managers/AIManager.gd`

### 6. CouncilManager Class
- **Issue**: CouncilManager class was referenced but did not exist
- **Fix**: Created `CouncilManager.gd` with basic functionality for diplomatic sessions and voting
- **File**: `res://scripts/managers/CouncilManager.gd`

### 7. Missing Type Definitions Resolved
All of these classes were already present in the codebase but were not being properly recognized:
- **Technology class**: `res://gamedata/technologies/technology.gd`
- **Empire class**: `res://gamedata/empires/empire.gd`
- **StarSystem class**: `res://gamedata/systems/star_system.gd`
- **PlanetData class**: `res://gamedata/celestial_bodies/planet_data.gd`
- **ShipData class**: `res://gamedata/ships/ship_data.gd`
- **GameData class**: `res://gamedata/game_data.gd`
- **GameSetupData class**: `res://gamedata/game_setup_data.gd`
- **ColonyData class**: `res://gamedata/colonies.gd`
- **CelestialBodyData class**: `res://gamedata/celestial_bodies/celestial_body_data.gd`
- **CelestialBodyGenerator class**: `res://scripts/generators/celestial_body_generator.gd`
- **GalaxyBuilder class**: `res://scripts/galaxy/GalaxyBuilder.gd`
- **SystemNameGenerator class**: `res://scripts/generators/system_name_generator.gd`
- **SystemNameData class**: `res://gamedata/systems/system_name_data.gd`

### 8. TechnologyEffectManager Static Function Calls
- **Issue**: Other scripts were calling TechnologyEffectManager methods as static functions
- **Fix**: The TechnologyEffectManager was already properly structured as a Node class with instance methods; the issue was resolved by ensuring proper instantiation and access

## Verification
- ✅ All syntax errors preventing compilation have been fixed
- ✅ All tests now pass ("All tests passed" output confirmed)
- ✅ No parse errors reported during script loading that prevent execution
- ✅ Pipeline completes successfully with exit code 0

## Remaining Issues (Non-Critical)
The pipeline now runs successfully, but there are still some minor issues that don't prevent compilation or test execution:

- Missing GUT class_names (import warning only)
- Missing audio resource files (import warnings only)

The core syntax issues that were blocking the CI/CD pipeline have been completely resolved and the test suite now runs successfully.
