Project Antares: AI-Actionable Development Roadmap

This document provides a detailed, step-by-step implementation plan for Project Antares. Each feature is broken down into small, actionable tasks suitable for an AI coding agent.

1. Core Game Mechanics (100% Complete)

GameManager.gd (100% Complete)

    Feature: Comprehensive game state tracking (e.g., active player, turn number, game phase). Define clear win/loss conditions.

    Development Steps to 100%:

        In GameManager.gd, define a GamePhase enum with values: SETUP, GALAXY_VIEW, COMBAT, COLONY_VIEW, GAME_OVER.

        Add a variable current_game_phase of type GamePhase to the GameManager.

        Create a function set_game_phase(new_phase: GamePhase) that updates the current_game_phase and emits a signal game_phase_changed(new_phase).

        Implement a function check_conquest_victory() -> bool that iterates through all empires and returns true if one empire owns the home systems of all others.

        Implement a placeholder function check_diplomatic_victory() -> bool that returns false for now.

        Implement a placeholder function check_score_victory() -> bool that returns false for now.

        Create a function check_for_victory() that calls all check_*_victory() functions and is called at the end of each turn.

        Connect to the player_won_game signal from PlayerManager and call a new function _on_victory("player_1", "Technology").

        Create a function _on_victory(winner_id: StringName, reason: String) that sets the game phase to GAME_OVER and transitions to the victory screen.

        Add a variable active_empires: Array[StringName] to track empires that have not been defeated.

        Implement a function eliminate_empire(empire_id: StringName) that removes an empire from the active_empires list.

        Integrate with SaveLoadManager to serialize and deserialize current_game_phase and active_empires.

turn_manager.gd (100% Complete)

    Feature: Develop a robust turn progression system that correctly cycles through players and AI, triggering necessary start-of-turn and end-of-turn events.

    Development Steps to 100%:

        In TurnManager.gd, add a variable turn_order: Array[StringName] to store the IDs of all empires in the game.

        Add a variable current_empire_index: int to track the position in the turn_order array.

        Create a function start_new_game(empires: Dictionary) that populates the turn_order array from the EmpireManager.

        Define two new signals: start_of_turn(empire_id: StringName) and end_of_turn(empire_id: StringName).

        Refactor the end_turn() function.

        Inside end_turn(), first emit end_of_turn(turn_order[current_empire_index]).

        Increment current_empire_index, using the modulo operator (%) to loop back to the start of the array.

        If current_empire_index is 0, it signifies a new round. Increment the current_turn counter.

        After updating the index, emit the start_of_turn(turn_order[current_empire_index]) signal for the new active empire.

        Check if the new active empire is AI-controlled. If so, call a new placeholder function AIManager.take_turn().

        Integrate with SaveLoadManager to serialize turn_order and current_empire_index.

SaveLoadManager.gd (100% Complete)

    Feature: Design a data serialization format for saving and loading game state. Implement functionality to write to and read from save files.

    Development Steps to 100%:

        Implement the _on_save_data_loaded function in GalaxyManager.gd to correctly parse the galaxy dictionary from a save file.

        Implement _on_save_data_loaded in PlayerManager.gd and AIManager.gd to parse ship data.

        Expand _serialize_galaxy_data in SaveLoadManager.gd to include all PlanetData properties (size, minerals, owner, population, etc.).

        Expand _on_save_data_loaded in GalaxyManager.gd to correctly deserialize all PlanetData properties.

        Implement saving and loading for the EmpireManager, storing the treasury, diplomatic_statuses, and other empire-level data.

        Create a "Load Game" screen that reads multiple save files from the user:// directory.

        Add functionality to name and delete save files from the "Load Game" screen.

        Implement a "quick save" function that saves to a default slot.

player_manager.gd (100% Complete)

    Feature: Expand to handle player-specific data, such as selected empire, owned colonies, and research progress.

    Development Steps to 100%:

        Remove the research_points and research_per_turn variables. This data will be moved to the Empire object.

        Modify the unlock_technology function to check and spend research points from player_empire.research_points.

        Create a function calculate_research_per_turn() that sums the research output from all player-owned colonies and updates player_empire.research_per_turn.

        Connect this function to be called at the start of each player turn.

        Remove the owned_ships dictionary. This data will be moved to the Empire object.

        Modify all ship-related functions (set_ship_destination, _process_ship_movement) to operate on player_empire.owned_ships.

        Implement a system to track all player-owned colonies.

        Refactor the save/load logic to serialize and deserialize the player_empire object.

        Update starmap.gd to visually render these new spatial phenomena.

        Modify the set_ship_destination function in PlayerManager to account for nebula travel penalties.

        Ensure all spatial phenomena data is saved and loaded by the SaveLoadManager.

celestial_body_generator.gd (100% Complete)

    Feature: Implement logic for generating a wider variety of planets, moons, and other celestial bodies with unique characteristics.

    Development Steps to 100%:

        Implement logic for the "Yellow Star" rule: if a system is designated as yellow, increase the probability of generating Terran planets.

        Create a weighted table for generating planet specials (Artifacts, Natives, Hostile Fauna, etc.).

        Add logic to generate moons for planets based on planet size.

        Create a MoonData resource.

3. Empire & Colony Management (100% Complete)

ColonyManager.gd (100% Complete)

    Feature: Implement core colony mechanics: colonization, population growth, and resource production.

        Implement the _process_population_growth function. Calculate food surplus/deficit and add to a growth_progress variable on the planet. When the threshold is met, add one population unit.

        Implement the _process_construction function. Apply the planet's production output to the current_build_progress of the first item in its construction_queue.

        When an item is complete, remove it from the queue, apply its effect (e.g., add a building to the planet), and start the next item.

        Create a colonize_planet(planet, empire) function that consumes a Colony Ship and establishes a new colony.

        Create a scrap_building(planet, building) function that removes a building and provides credits.

        Implement logic to handle tech prerequisites.

        Create a system to apply the effects of unlocked technologies (e.g., add new buildable items, update empire-wide stats).

5. User Interface (100% Complete)

HUD (100% Complete)

    Feature: Design and implement a functional in-game HUD that displays key information.

    Development Steps to 100%:

        Connect the right-sidebar panels to the live data from the PlayerManager and Empire objects instead of using dummy data.

        The "Fleet" panel should display the total number of military ships.

        The "Food" panel should display the empire-wide food surplus or deficit.

        The "Research" panel should display the current research project and turns until completion.
