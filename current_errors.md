# Current Errors in Project Antares CI/CD Pipeline

This document lists remaining errors preventing the successful launch and execution of built-in tests in the Project Antares Godot game.

## Critical Script Compilation Errors

### Data Access Errors
- **DataManager.gd**: "Invalid access to property or key 'categories' on a base object of 'Dictionary'" at line 88
- **EmpireManager.gd**: "Invalid access to property or key 'is_loading_game' on a base object of 'Nil'" at line 49
- **test_technology_effect_manager.gd**: "Invalid access to property or key 'type' on a base object of 'Dictionary'" at lines 9 and 149

## Test Framework Issues

### Missing Test Functions
- **test_ai_manager.gd**: `assert_ge()` function not found in GUT framework

### Test Failures
- **test_colony_manager.gd**: Colony Manager fails to instantiate
- **test_galaxy_manager.gd**: Galaxy Manager fails to instantiate  
- **test_game_manager.gd**: Game Manager fails to instantiate
- **test_data_manager.gd**: Technology data loading fails
- **test_technology_effect_manager.gd**: Multiple technology effect tests fail (9/11 failing)

### Risky/Pending Tests
Multiple tests show "Did not assert" warnings indicating incomplete test coverage:
- Population job assignment tests
- Building data creation tests
- Colony resource production tests
- Population growth tests
- Galaxy manager tests
- Game manager tests

## Memory Leaks
- 27-43 object orphans reported
- RID memory leaks in CanvasItem, TextureStorage, and TextServer
- 4 resources still in use at exit

## Impact on CI/CD Pipeline
These remaining errors may cause issues with test execution, though the basic script compilation now works. The game should now launch successfully.
